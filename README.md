# Java Do-While Loop: Controlled Exit Flow

Welcome to the Java Do-While Loop: Controlled Exit Flow repository! This repository contains a concise Java program (`Loop.java`) that demonstrates the power of the do-while loop for controlled exit flow.

## Description

In this program, we explore the flexibility of the do-while loop to execute a block of code at least once and then continue based on a specified condition. 
The loop iterates while the condition is true, providing a mechanism for controlled exit flow. This approach ensures that the loop executes at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the program:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Loop.java`.
4. Compile the Java file with the command:
5. Run the compiled program using:
6. Witness the controlled exit flow in action as the program iterates through the do-while loop, printing "Hi" followed by incremented numbers.

## Controlled Exit Flow

The do-while loop is particularly useful when you need to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of the condition's initial value. 
It provides a structured approach to controlled exit flow, ensuring that the loop continues as long as the condition remains true. This allows for dynamic and flexible programming, 
enhancing code readability and maintainability.
